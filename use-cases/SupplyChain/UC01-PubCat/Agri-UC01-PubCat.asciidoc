The catalog is available

Only product specification is published based on which the offers and bids will be published by the marketplace participants.

While the product specification is public, the offers and bids may not be public. The offer and bid use-cases are will be covered as separate document.

The Catalog is published in https://ipfs.io[IPFS] as a https://www.sqlite.org/index.html[Sqlite] file.

The Marketplace is the creator of the smart contract. It publishes the catalog and also, updates its own credentials: OpenPGP certificate 
 
The above information maps the PGP public key with the Ethereum Key pair and the site URL. The OpenPGP certificate must contain the  site URL address.
 
The Marketplace may choose to use another CAS (Content Addressable Storage) other than IPFS; for example, Couch-db (like Hyperledger Fabric does) or Ethereum Swarm.

The smart contract would contain the CAS name, CAS Hash, and a detached signature of the published catalog file.

The marketplace will also publish and update the participant status and roles, after due KYC (Know Your Customers).

The KYC & due diligence process will be manual by email and the uploaded certificate MUST have the marketplace's signature.
