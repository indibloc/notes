This document outlines the overview of the `EthBzr`, a distributed B2B (Business to Business) commerce marketplace on Ethereum platform.

Though this can run on both public and consortium network mode. We are implementing it on a consortium Ethereum network, to comply with Indian regulations.

The marketplace is designed to cater to both goods and services.

== Introduction
`EthBzr` is conceptualized as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application[ƒêApp] on Ethereum platform, running over a public and consortium network mode. 

The concomitant data, like human readable legal contracts, are saved in a CAS (Content Addressable Storage).
The content can be optionally be encrypted. 

.The supported CAS are:  
. IPFS
. Ethereum Swarm
. Couch DB


*STATUS: Work In Progress (WIP)*

== Regulatory Compliance
Like all democratic countries Indian laws are complex and multiple agencies are there with various jurisdctions which a blockchain network needs to comply with. 

Prominent among them are: 

. https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/OccasionalPublications.aspx?head=Reserve%20Bank%20of%20India%20Act[RBI Act]:   bars cryptocurrency minting
. https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=1&ssid=1&smid=0[SEBI Act]:   bars ICO (Initial Coin Offering) & creation of cryptocurrency exchanges.
. https://m.rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=8179[Anti-Money Laundering (AML)] standards/Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) rules.
. https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/fema.aspx[Foreign Exchange Management Act]

We spent more than 9 months, researching, consulting with legal experts and Charted Accountants to help us navigate the Legal Maze.

we can now confidently summarize our findings in one sentence:

**Blockchain is yet another Information Technology (IT). You must comply with the laws of the land.**

The Blockchain  needs to be permission-ed network for KYC (Know Your Customers),AML and CFT.

Thus for the IndiBloc Blockchain network, we have used Ethereum private network with PoA (Proof of Authority) as the consensus algorithm.


=== Nodal Account
RBI issued a guidelines https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Mode=0&Id=5379[directions for opening and operation of Accounts and settlement of payments for electronic payment transactions involving intermediaries, on 24 November 2009], that applies to e-commerce marketplaces. 

Thus all marketplaces like Amazon & Flop Cart are required maintain an escrow account with a Bank. Though RBI left it to the banks to name this account; most banks call it "Nodal Account", since RBI had used the phrase "Nodal Bank" in it's directive.

Thus from our implementation perspective, the Nodal bank's account is the primary storage of value and NOT the cryptocurrency nor any crypto-tokens. This value is reflected in Blockchain network as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20[ERC20] tokens issuance.
  

=== Crypto Tokens
The crypto-tokens that are inherent to the Blockchain network architecture, is required for protecting the network and service fee distribution.

As an architecture choice, we have used Ethereum private network with PoA (Proof of Authority) as the consensus algorithm.
In this mode, the tokens are minted once, and attached to a set of pre-funded accounts. These accounts must responsibly distribute the tokens so that only KYC compliant participants only can get access to the network resources. 
 

== Actors & Roles
The participants are called Actors with various Roles.

In the B2B network, we assume that all the participants are IT enabled and have ability to manage crypto key pairs.

Those users who cannot manage key pairs or lack IT infrastructure, transact through a trusted intermediary, like a portal.

.Roles  
. Administrators (admin)
. Regulators
. Buyers
. Sellers
. Arbitrators

== Business Cycles

The life cycle consists of the following high level processes:

. Partner Lifecycle
.. Off boarding/On boarding
.. Fees Accounting
. Product Lifecycle (Publish to Quote)
.. Product Specification cycle
.. Offer and Quote cycle
. Transactions (Order to Cash)
