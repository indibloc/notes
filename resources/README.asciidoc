=== Minds


https://www.minds.com[Minds] uses ERC20 Tokens on Ethereum, as of 20th May 2018, it was on the Test Net and not the Main net.

While Minds Social Network strives to reward the contributors and viewers by issuing tokens, and connecting the rewards to fiat currency.

It has Off-chain wallet as well as an On-chain wallet. he off-chain wallet is used to save the Ethereum gas (transaction fees).

Minds is *NOT* a true P2P distributed content platform, but a centralized aggregation driven platform with a user-content rewarding system. Minds, in my view, directly competes with Facebook.com ; What stops Facebook to introduce a reward system similar to That of Minds.com ?

A true P2P Platform should use a distributed CAS (Content Addressable Storage) system like https://ipfs.io[IPFS] or http://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html[Ethereum Swarm].

One such example of P2P distributed platform is https://www.openbazaar.org[Open Bazaar]. It uses IPFS as data store and Bitcoin as the Internet of Value.
