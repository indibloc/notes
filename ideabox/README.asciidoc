= Idea Box: Ideas Incubation 

Idea Box contains the ideas in incubation within the IndiBloc community

Ideas are born in minds, then cooked in our group. Once it takes some shape we give it a code name and list it here.
Once a Level 0 document is created, it is placed here. A group within the community may decide to work on it.

If they reach a milestone, we will create a project in github. If the idea goes stale or goes inactive, we archive the git project, and move the documents to the 'freezer' directory.

If the idea gets to an alpha stage the documents are moved to the `wiki` pages of IndiBloc doc.
